# PredictingCustomerChurn
predict which customers are more likely to leave the bank soon using keras (Sequential API)

# Problem Definition
The problem addressed in this dataset is the high rate of customer churn experienced by a bank. The bank is interested in investigating and predicting which customers are more likely to leave the institution in the near future.
The objective is to analyze this dataset using artificial neural networks to build a predictive model that can accurately identify customers at a higher risk of leaving the bank.
# Conclusion 
By comparing the accuracy results of  SVM the pre-trained model and ANN model ,The ANN model has proven to be highly effective in analyzing the provieded dataset.
